# Overview over Analysis

## Pipelines

1. **Preparation Pipeline**: Creates samples and features used for evaluation and analysis
2. **Evaluation Pipeline**: Evaluates a given model based on given metrics and saves results to a single csv
3. **Analysis Pipeline**: Performs main steps which are needed for analysis, further plots can be created, and analysis be performed, based on data created by this pipeline. It includes:
   1. Prototypes
   2. Clusters 
   3. Gemoterics

## Different Plots
